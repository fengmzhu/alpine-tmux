* alpine-tmux
This is a simple Docker image containing =tmux= and =psql=.

** Build it
Run =./build= to get an image.

** Use it
Start a server with =docker run -ti sduckett/alpine-tmux:latest /usr/bin/tmux
new-session -s fun-and-profit=. =tmux= in a Docker environment is a little
strange; the server will probably exit when there are no clients connected. You
can detach from the docker container with =C-p C-q= (by default). Taking a look
at =docker ps=, you should still see the image running.

Connect to the running container with =docker exec -ti $CONTAINER_ID tmux
attach=, where the =CONTAINER_ID= matches your worldview, and if you're doing
multiple sessions, your session of choice.
